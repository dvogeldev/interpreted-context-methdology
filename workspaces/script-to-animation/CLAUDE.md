# Script-to-Animation

This workspace guides you from a content idea through script writing, animation specification, and build -- one stage at a time.

## Triggers

| Keyword | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `setup` | Run onboarding questionnaire -- configures brand, voice, audience, platform |
| `status` | Show pipeline completion for all three stages |

### How `status` works

Scan `stages/*/output/` folders. For each stage, if the output folder contains files (other than .gitkeep), the stage is COMPLETE. Otherwise it is PENDING. Render:

```
Pipeline Status: script-to-animation

  [01-script]  ------>  [02-spec]  ------>  [03-build]
     STATUS               STATUS              STATUS
  (files...)            (files...)           (files...)
```

## Routing

| Task | Go To |
|------|-------|
| Write a script | `stages/01-script/CONTEXT.md` |
| Create an animation spec | `stages/02-spec/CONTEXT.md` |
| Build Remotion code | `stages/03-build/CONTEXT.md` |
| Configure this workspace | `setup/questionnaire.md` |

## What to Load

| Task | Load These | Do NOT Load |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Write a script | `brand-vault/voice-rules.md`, `brand-vault/identity.md`, `stages/01-script/references/*`, `shared/platform-specs.md` | `skills/remotion-best-practices/`, `stages/02-spec/references/`, `stages/03-build/references/` |
| Create animation spec | `stages/01-script/output/`, `stages/02-spec/references/*`, `skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` | `brand-vault/`, `stages/01-script/references/`, `stages/03-build/references/`, `skills/remotion-best-practices/` |
| Build Remotion code | `stages/02-spec/output/`, `stages/03-build/references/*`, `skills/remotion-best-practices/SKILL.md`, `stages/02-spec/references/design-system.md` | `brand-vault/`, `stages/01-script/`, `stages/02-spec/references/spec-format.md`, `stages/02-spec/references/animation-guide.md` |

## Stage Handoffs

Each stage writes its output to its own `output/` folder. The next stage reads from there. If you edit an output file between stages, the next stage picks up your edits. This is the primary way to steer the pipeline.
