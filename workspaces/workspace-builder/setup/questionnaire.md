# Onboarding Questionnaire: Workspace Builder

Read this file when the user types "setup". Ask ALL questions below in a single conversational pass. The user should be able to answer everything in one message. These answers inform the discovery conversation in Stage 01 -- they are not placeholder replacements.

---

### Q1: What domain is this workspace for?
- Examples: "podcast production", "blog writing", "course creation", "design system management"
- Type: free text
- Purpose: Names the workspace and sets the scope

### Q2: Describe the end-to-end workflow in one sentence.
- Examples: "Take a topic idea through research, outlining, drafting, and editing to produce a published blog post."
- Type: free text
- Purpose: Gives Stage 01 a starting point for deeper discovery

### Q3: Who will use this workspace, and what is their skill level with AI tools?
- Type: free text
- Purpose: Calibrates complexity. Include what tools they already use if relevant.

### Q4: Roughly how many stages, and are any skippable?
- Type: free text (a number or brief list, plus which stages are optional)
- Purpose: Helps Stage 01 ask the right depth of questions
- Note: This is an estimate. The actual stages will be refined during discovery.

### Q5: What deployment environments will this project use (e.g., local, staging, production) and where will environment variables be managed?
- Type: free text
- Purpose: Determines how to handle .env files and branch strategy for the generated workspace
- Examples: "Local development only with .env.development", "Local -> Staging -> Production with .env for production only", "Local development with .env.local, staging with .env.staging, production with .env"

### Q6: What is the preferred branch strategy for local development?
- Type: free text
- Purpose: Establishes git workflow conventions for the generated workspace
- Examples: "Work in dev branch, feature branches from dev", "Work in main directly for small projects", "Use trunk-based development with short-lived branches"

## After Onboarding

Tell the user: "Got it. When you are ready, start with Stage 01 -- Discovery. I will walk you through a conversation to map out the full workflow."

Then point them to `stages/01-discovery/CONTEXT.md`.
